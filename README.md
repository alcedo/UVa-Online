Notes
==========
The program reads the test input from the standard input (stdin) and places the results in the standard output (stdout).
This is always the case, regardless on what the problem description says.

Every line in the input is guaranteed to be finished by the end-of-line character ('\n').

*In a similar way, your program must print an end-of-line character at the end of every line*

A correct output with a missing end-of-line character will not be judged as Accepted.
